 * `.Logo` Currently does nothing, but you can use `#celery.celery-logo()` mixin
 * to inject the Celery logo as an SVG background image. Otherwise, the svg is
 * included in the directory for your own usage in html or stylesheets.

 * ```
 * .Logo--celery {
 *   #celery.celery-logo;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *     @example
 *     div.Logo.Logo--celery
